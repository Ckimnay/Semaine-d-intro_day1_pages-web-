    	<h2> Seriously, you guys think that a fucking website doesn't need some styling?
    	</h2>
    	<p>You probably build websites using vim and feeling hardcore. You think your 4.99KB <span class="mfw"> motherfuckingwebsite</span>(.com) is going to get you some fucking award to put on your damn footer as a link. You think your fucking default font is gonna make your website run even on a toaster.
    	</p>
    	<p> <span class="wr"> WRONG </span> , motherfucker.</p>

    	<h2>The best kick-ass website </h2>
    	<p> Let me describe the real perfect-ass website which still has the glory of the past <span class="mwf"motherfuckingwebsites:</span>: </p>
    		<ul>
    			<li>Shit doesn't weigh a ton (in fact it's just 34.97 KB when the 27.83KB cat picture below is removed)</li>
    			<li>The page weighs exactly 63.02kB, 93.7% less than the <a href="https://www.google.com/"> Google home page</a> </li>
    			<li>Fits on your iPhone 1st gen (although it doesn't work on your damn 16x32 Tamagotchi)</li>
    			<li>Looks <em>almost</em> the same on every screen</li>
    			<li> Every asshole that visits this website can use it without any problem <span small"well" >well, kind of</span> </li>
